The Problem We're Solving
It's tough for students (and me!) to keep track of daily spending. We often buy food and small
things, and then we forget where the money went. This makes it hard to manage our budgets.
Our Solution
I built this small program to help solve that problem! It lets you record all your daily expenses in
one easy place. Now you can clearly see exactly where your money goes.
What You Need (Project Requirements)
• Coding Environment: A code editor like Visual Studio Code.
• Language: Python.
What the Program Does:
When the project is finished, the program will allow you to:
• Input your expenses each day.
• View a list of all your recorded expenses.
• See the total amount of money you've spent.
• Keep a clear record of all your spending habits.
Implementation Details
This program uses basic Python concepts to work:
• Lists: We use lists to store and keep track of all the expense records.
• Functions: Different functions are used to handle different actions, such as adding a new
expense or showing the total amount spent.
• Simple Math: We use simple mathematical operations to calculate the total sum of all
your expenses.
Future Ideas (Enhancements)
I plan to improve this program in the future by adding these features:
• Expense Categories: Allow users to tag expenses (e.g., food, travel, entertainment) for a
more organized view of spending.
• Editing & Deleting: Give users the ability to correct mistakes or remove old expenses.
• Monthly Summaries: Add a feature to view and analyze total expenses for a specific
month.
Conclusion
Creating this project was a great way to understand how basic Python programming concepts can
be applied to solve simple, everyday problems. I was able to build a small, functional application
that genuinely helps with managing daily spending.
